Download and extract the agent installer to the computer on which you want to install the agent:

Method 1
To download the installer, log in to the server and click the Help icon  at the upper right of any page on the server, and click Tools. Then, click IBM UrbanCode Deploy Agent, and download and extract the file.

Method 2
To find the installer on the server with the command line, go to the following location, and copy the file to the target computer: installation_folder/opt/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/tools/ibm-ucd-agent.zip

After you download and expand the installation package, open the installer directory.
From this directory, run install-agent.bat (Windows) or install-agent.sh (UNIX or Linux).
