Docker 
==========================
What is Docker?
	Container Tool

What is Container?

30 YEARS BEFORE
=============================
IF I WANT TO SETUP A SERVER (ProD - No Prod)....

What is the Approach you follow - 20 Years --- PHYSICAL SERVER ERA
------------------------------------
10 SERVER
		10 CPU | 
		10 RAM  | 3GB RAM --> 5 GB
		10 HDD
		10 OS
		-----------
		1 Month

		UTI % --- 15 %
		WASTE --- 85%

		USE OF SERVER WAS LESS ---> 

What is the Approach you follow - 15 Years -----> Virtualization
		Explosion of Internet + related Service
1000 SERVERS
		1000 CPU | 
		1000 RAM  | 3GB RAM --> 5 GB
		1000 HDD
		1000 OS
		-----------
		1 Month

		BUT THE PRB - INTERNET n RELEATED R FREE

		LESS COSTLY
		SETUP A SERVER QUICKER

vmware
virtualbox
xen

aws
	1000 SERVERS
		10 PHYSICAL SERVER ---> 1000 VMS


What is the Approach you follow - Now

	1GB GMAIL - 15 GB
	Unlimit Yotuube
	Unlimit Phots
	We dont want to pay any services but we want use everything free of cost+Unlimited


Company Main Objective is ----RUNNING APP, IN less cost n in No time.....

================================================
Container Based Technology ----- Docker , Rocket


How Docker makes each Container(App) works on the same OS(Base OS0) n still behave isolate?

USER SPACE  
	WINDOWS
	LINUX - 10 USER - 10 USER SPACE -- EACH R ISOLATED
					COMMON - EACH ONE OF THE 
							USER SPACE C:\Users\Rajesh
							COMMON SPACe ---C/D

Container ---
					Each of Processes| Drive | App| Services | Permission
					is derived from Copy of the Base OS
					Each are isoltaed?

How it is Possible?
		Docker Engine
				Kernal Namespace  --- Netowrk, Drives, Process
				Kernal Capabilities -- Permission
				Kernal Cgroups	  ---- CPU n RAM Allocation to each container

Why we call it container?

Shipyard of 1900 ----					 --- 100 Commerce
			Cargos shapes n Size are diff


							100000000000000000 Commerce

Shipping the cargo...

China ---> RawM(Africa) --> Product --> Worlds --- STILL IT IS CHEAPER
Transport === Shippment===Trade has become very very less costly
				
esolution -----Container---
			Same Standard process to ship the cargo


IT ------> Shippment of APPS (10, 15)

Shippment of APPS (100000, 1500000)
			Less Costly
			Faster
==============================================
SAVIING COST + TIME
===================================================

How can i start using Docker technoloy...

Docker Engine --- a tool which can help you to manage container	-- DONE
Docker Image --- Static Version of the APP.				---DONE
Docker Repo --- You get a images from Public(hub) or pvt repo(nexus)   --DONE
Docker Container --- Running state of the image is called Container

			USING ONE IMAGE. --- You can run 1000s container....

Install - http://www.devopsschool.com/tutorial/docker/docker-install-and-configuration.html

> docker info
> docker help

> docker images
> docker ps
> docker run
# How to run images to get containers...._ Instructions you get only from Image Developer....
> docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins

-p ---Port Mapping
8080:8080 external:internal
jenkins - Image name

> docker help run

jenkins--> MASteR(8080) - Slave(master-50000)

> docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins

> docker exec -it 42ce01e49686 /bin/bash

How to come out of the Container
> CTLR + P + Q

How to stop the container?
> docker stop cont_id
> docker ps -a
How to start the container?
> docker start cont_id

How to remove the container
> docker rm cont_id

How to remove the images?
> docker rmi image-id

How to see the pprocess inside the container
> docker top cont_id

How to see log of the container
> docker logs cont_id

How to debug /info of the container
			images
> docker inspect cont_id
> docker inspect image_id

Networking
> docker network ls

bridge -CIDR Range ---> Container Gets a IP Address

host   			--- Host IP address will be the container IP addrees	                       
none    			NO IP Addres to cont====Cont is isolated in the world            

How to Create images?
		1- Createing a imgages from Container
		docker commit -a "Rajesh" -m"This is for demo" 7338290fe975 ub-git

		2. Creating a Images from Dockerfile

WHY EXIT Happen?
		ONE CONTAINER - AT LEAST ONE RUNNING PROCESS MUST BE THERE TO HOLD THE CONTAINER


Docker for windws
		Docker toolbox (Linux VM [DE + Im + C)
		Docker for Windows --> Hyper(Windows VM)- DE --> Container 2016 onwards...

How to share image with others?
		Pub repo --->    
		pri repo -- NEXUS
		tarball 

How my containers will be accessed by others?
