How to attach AWS EBS to multiple Instance?
==============================================================
NO. We should start looking at the new Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), which is designed to be multiply attached in exactly the way you are wanting. The key difference between EFS and EBS is that they provide different abstractions: EFS exposes the NFSv4 protocol, whereas EBS provides raw block IO access

Why is this a bad idea? ... The reason you can't attach a volume to more than one instance is that EBS provides a "block storage" abstraction upon which customers run a filesystem like ext2/ext3/etc. Most of these filesystems (eg, ext2/3, FAT, NTFS, etc) are written assuming they have exclusive access to the block device. Two instances accessing the same filesystem would almost certainly end in tears and data corruption.
