How to change port -
Although we highly discourage it, it is possible to change the listening port of Artifactory to listen on port 80 by making sure that the user that runs Artifactory has “admin” permissions and modifying the 'server.xml' file that is situated at: '$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/tomcat/conf/server.xml'.
