Why do we make a new cookbook dependent upon one or more different cookbooks?
1. So that we don't breach copyright
2. So that we can make use of Berkshelf
3. So we can avoid having to duplicate code
4. So that we can manage a node running Linux

Why should we always encrypt credentials which are stored in data bags?
1. We cannot create un-encrypted values on Chef Server.
2. So that we do not expose sensitive passwords in plaintext
3. Some cookbooks, like apt, require encrypted credentials.
4. We don't need to encrypt credentials, Chef does this automatically.
5. Berkshelf will not upload cookbooks containing unencrypted data bag values.
Ans :-  2. So that we do not expose sensitive passwords in plaintext

Why are hard-coded values in a Chef recipe or template a bad idea?
1. Some platforms (like Windows) don't support hard-coded values.
2. They increase processing time.
3. From version 12 onwards, Chef does not support hard-coded values.
4. They make the code inflexible and not reusable.
5. They are a good idea as they reduce processing time.
Ans :-  4. They make the code inflexible and not reusable. 

When using the ChefDK to generate a new recipe, do you need to specify the .RB file extension?
1. Yes, but only if you're running Windows.
2. No, Visual Studio Code does this automatically.
3. Yes, otherwise you can't edit the file.
4. No, all files in a Chef repository automatically use the .RB file extension.

4. Chef Zero
5. --local-mode
Ans :-  3. Chef Zero Scheduled Task

What should you do if "kitchen converge" encounters an error?
1. Use a different Test Kitchen provisioner
2. Use "kitchen destroy"
3. Remediate the error and run "kitchen converge" again
4. Nothing - errors are expected
5. Upload the cookbook into production
Ans :-  3. Remediate the error and run "kitchen converge" again

How do you specify different attributes so that your cookbook will work with Vagrant/Test Kitchen?
1. Use override attributes in the vagrantfile
2. Create [default][kitchen] attributes in the cookbook's default.rb attributes file
3. Use override attributes in the cookbook's .kitchen.yml file
4. Chef Zero will automatically modify any attributes needed.
Ans :-  3. Use override attributes in the cookbook's .kitchen.yml file

How do you use a Chef resource which is defined in a different cookbook?
1. Use the include_cookbook Chef resource in your own cookbook
2. Create a dependency on the external cookbook in your cookbook's metadata.rb file
3. You should always re-create Chef functionality from scratch in each cookbook.
4. Use GEM INSTALL to download the cookbook to the ChefDK
Ans :-  2. Create a dependency on the external cookbook in your cookbook's metadata.rb file
