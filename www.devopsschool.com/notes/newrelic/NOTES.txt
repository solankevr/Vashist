New Relic is a SaaS application performance management (APM) tool that combines Real User Monitoring (RUM) with
deep, component-level visibility into web applications. 

New Relic gives developers real-time visibility onto user experiences and application performance. With a single tool, application teams can:
	Measure front-end performance including browser response, page load times, and Apdex
	Monitor app performance at the component level and spot potential bottlenecks 
	Determine if performance issues are in the front end, the app, or the network
	New Relic monitoring is part of the CloudBees Ecosystem, so you can turn it on for any of your
applications with a few clicks.
