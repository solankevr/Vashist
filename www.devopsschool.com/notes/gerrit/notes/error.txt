gerrit submit button is not enabled for admin

the submit button should appear as soon as a reviewer has voted +2 on the label "Code Review" and, if the "Verified" label is installed, +1 on "Verified". Then the change status should become "Ready to Submit" and the submit button should be displayed [1]. In addition you need the "Submit" access right [2].

SSH/HTTP/Anonymous HTTP Clone URL not visible in Gerrit

SOL
This issue has to do with not installing the download-commands plugin for Gerrit. During initialization Gerrit prompts the user to install plugins. If the user says no (or if the installation is performed in --batch mode), the plugins will not be installed.
