Install Puppet Agent
The Puppet agent software must be installed on any server that the Puppet master will manage. In most cases, this will include every server in your infrastructure. As mentioned in the introduction, the Puppet agent can run on all major Linux distributions, some UNIX platforms, and Windows. Because the installation varies on each OS slightly, we will only cover the installation on CentOS 7 servers. 

[H3]Perform these steps on all of your agent servers.

[B]Enable the official Puppet Labs collection repository with this command:
[COMMAND]
$ sudo rpm -ivh https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm


[B]Install the puppet-agent package:
[COMMAND]
sudo yum -y install puppet-agent

[B]
Now that the Puppet agent is installed, start it with this command:
[COMMAND]
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource service puppet ensure=running enable=true

[H3]Sign Certificates on Puppet Master
The first time Puppet runs on an agent node, it will send a certificate signing request to the Puppet master. Before Puppet Server will be able to communicate with and control the agent node, it must sign that particular agent node's certificate. We will describe how to sign and check for signing requests.

[COMMAND START]

#On the Puppet master, run the following command to list all unsigned certificate requests:
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list

#Sign A Request
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign host1.nyc3.example.com

#If you want to sign all of the current requests, use the --all option, like so:
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign --all

#Revoke Certificates
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert clean hostname

#View All Signed Requests
$ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list --all

[COMMAND END]
